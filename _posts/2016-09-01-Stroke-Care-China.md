<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in China.<!--more--> China’s Stroke Registry estimates that China will face 2 million new stroke cases annually. The purpose of this literature review is to critically look at China’s ability to handle a stroke emergency. This emergency has clear time constraints based on the effectiveness of thrombolysis – otherwise known as the “golden window.” Because of this time-sensitive nature, the three delays model which was originally developed for maternal mortality has been adapted to help investigate factors prohibiting stroke patients from meeting the time for treatment. The “delay in the decision to seek care” is an exploration of the factors affecting care-seeking behaviours and health service utilisation at the individual/patient level. “The delay in reaching care” depends on the infrastructure of emergency health services in the prehospital setting. We discuss the development of the emergency system, its present state and how its current organisation affects stroke emergencies specifically the onset-to-door time. Finally, “the delay in receiving adequate care” looks at the organisation of Chinese emergency departments and examines the factors preventing timely treatment, clinical pathways, and quality improvement mechanisms. The stroke care pathway, a diagram of all the services relevant to stroke care, serves as a framework that allows us to see how these distinct pieces of China’s health system interact. What are the challenges and barriers to implementing a comprehensive stroke care pathway in China? And how can China’s health system improve itself to face the growing urgency that is stroke?</p>
