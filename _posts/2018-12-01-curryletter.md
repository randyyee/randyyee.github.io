Hey man, I heard bout
the letter you sent
to that girl bout
your Curry 5s.
That's real cool, man.
I was wondering,
saw that there were no
shoes for those dudes
on courts discontent,
who grew up in cramped
spaces with hula hoops steadied
between storage boxes
in the garage, we studied
signature moves to
deceive thy brother,
and when they finally received
the blessed hoop, found them
without a stand, they
would not let you hammer it up
ruining the side of the house;
sizing you up for uniforms to be
hot in practice against the A squad,
hearing the opposing coach yell
to hold up hands against your sweet J
that's when you made it,
the sweet rhythm and blues
promising a jersey to a school boo
a sweet nothing, not honest in youth
who walked home out of
high school tryouts
realizing too late,
the shot clock down,
now relegated to
bare naked hoops with no springs,
bald-faced backboards,
thwarting shots with great clangs,
pumping the ball with handheld needles,
struggling against underinflated ball,
feeling the pronounced gorge of over inflation,
pushing back dinnertime,
because each game was a battle,
the urge to body defender,
the specter of meanness,
the punitive measure,
but by your side,
a wizard of assists,
feeding you hand to basket,
the greatest meal of all.
Just wandering if you can
speak to the Under Armour folks
about shoes for dudes no longer nascent
with abandoned dunks
of basketball superstardom;
genuflect to the
dudes throwing up the rock
all by themselves after work
rediscovering the
new physics of the swish
sacrament of the 3, oh blessed
shoes to be cool
pushing back the dinnertime
just like before.
You know, when you get the chance
because we want to
rock those Curry 5s too.
