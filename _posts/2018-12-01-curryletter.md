Hey man, I heard bout  
the letter you sent  
to that girl regarding  
your Curry 5s.  
That's real cool, man.  
I was wondering,  
saw that there were no  
shoes for those dudes  
on courts discontent,  
who grew up in cramped  
spaces, coveting shoes,  
with hula hoops steadied  
between storage boxes  
in the garage, we grew  
a scholar of plastic,  
convinced they were innovating  
signature moves to  
deceive brothers emulating,  
but when they finally received  
the holy hoop, found themselves awry,  
without support. They  
would not let you hammer it up  
in this house, but we had  
a team for every child,  
before we suit up, they  
sized you up, and in uniforms  
you could learn early on to be legit.  
With that confidence, the key open sesamed,  
be hot in practice, young me,  
go for the A squad, channel that speed,  
metabolic machine,  
and when you hear  
the opposing coach yell  
"put up your goddamn hands, raise!"  
useless against your honed J, sweet fade;  
that's when you made it, praise  
the sweet rhythm and blues  
who promising a jersey  
to a grade school boo  
a sweet nothing, not honest in youth,  
not secure among fools,  
but regret for those dudes  
who walkin out of school  
not with their dues, of  
high school tryouts, lose,  
realized too late,  
the shot clock run down,  
then relegated to the  
steadiness of the track and field, and  
bare naked hoops with no springs,  
bald-faced backboards with grey stains,  
thwarting shots with great clangs,  
pumping the ball with bent tubes,  
struggling against an underinflated ball,  
feeling the pronounced bulge of the over pumped,  
pushing back dinner,  
because each game was a archaic,  
the urge to body defender,  
charge a man down,  
lay it all to the democracy of refs,  
but by your side,  
a wizard of assists,  
feeding you to the basket,  
letting you float through the gaze  
of that yearned for cutie  
(from 8-3 and then overtime).  
We believe; I believe.  
Just wandering if you can  
speak to the Under Armour folks  
about shoes for dudes no longer nascent  
no longer improving verticals  
to basketball superstardom;  
genuflect to the  
dudes throwing up the rock  
all by their lonesome after work  
heat checking the  
remnants of the swish, the  
sacrament of the 3, oh blessed  
shoes to be cool,  
pushing back the dinner  
just like those dudes.  
You know, when you get the chance  
because we want it too  
rock those Curry 5 shoes.
