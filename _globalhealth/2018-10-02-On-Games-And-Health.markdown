I would like to argue that “gamification” is or can be a powerful tool for optimizing health care and should be co-opted by the global health community. <!--more-->Gamification implemented correctly can do much to illuminate obscure processes, optimize healthcare pathways, and rejuvenate primary healthcare activities.

I was introduced to “gamification” long ago when I was working in the San Francisco the game industry.  At first glance, “gamification” seems like one of those darling buzz words symptomatic of the Millennial generation, and indeed it has been an insufferable patronizing practice taken advantage of by marketing.

First coined by Nick Pelling in the service statement from his short lived consultancy in 2002. Since then, it has been readily expropriated by the business world in their never ending pursuit for coolness. Its uses so far have been painfully superficial – strictly Pavlovian in its extent. Consumers quickly wised up to these tactics and they were seen as annoying add-ons to regular transactions of commerce. Buy from us and get points. Use those points to get stuff. Repeat ad nauseum. For employees, a special hell: work harder to be at the top of the leaderboard (a scarred whiteboard with oily smudges and tape fragments). The main victims are the passive population, customers and employees. It has been a convoluted interruption in the guise of fun, yet to demonstrate its full value.

 Gamification encompasses two main activities: user engagement and user retention. The problem is that so far the strategy has focused on the retention side which has stunted its potential. It is the obvious result of the outcome-centric culture championed by professional managers. It needs to be done well and thoughtfully - a well crafted user experience leading to mutually beneficial outcomes for all.

The field of health is a field that prizes clarity and transparency. But it was been bogged down by the inevitable end of bureaucracy. Many lack the understanding of how disparate services fit together to deliver care. Payments, for example, is a major can of worms. Patients rowing with tellers are a common sight around hospital all over the world. Is there anyone who can explain the discrepancies between costs and charges? In the end, everyone is befuddled. It is no wonder how pervasive distrust perception of bureaucratic enigma, Kafkaesque or at worst full of trivialities.

In the modern era, integration is the mantra of health systems development, a necessity from the chaos of multiple well-meaning people doing their own thing. Healthcare in the developing world has always relied on outside help to fill gaps where resources have been stretched thin. The problem is that the majority of these services do not integrate smoothly into the larger health system, and this disconnect to the larger governing body makes population health planning and policy difficult, effectively gumming up the works when we try to improve any one component of the health system.

So a plan for integration is well-meaning first-step but with little substance. One might imagine a unit convening in a carpeted room in Geneva HQ. what's your idea? Lets integrate so and so. But what does this action entail? Who is missing from this recommendation process? A lot of stakeholders. Gamification offers the opportunity for the dissemination of a great system, and every player has their own unique perspective to contribute.

But together we can figure this all out...

So the first step is system simulation. Here we translate existing processes and pathways "as-is." We like to have all the stakeholders participate in the development of the simulation: patients, staff, vendors, healthcare workers, nurses, doctors, etc.

But how do we go from simulation to game? It's only a simulation if there are no participants. So we'll have to open up some of the parameters for user-input/manipulation. This allows the players to see how certain actions or decisions affect the system as a whole. Every role will have their own unique set of parameters. Players will be able to find insights by playing with their own defined set of skills and also by rotating around and experiencing other roles.

Finally, we should be defining goals or "winning the game." This can be a combination of goals - some sort of performance outcome (reduced maternal mortality) tied to a budget constraint. Having stakeholders from every level play the game allows us to work on these problems from a truly multidisciplinary foundation.
