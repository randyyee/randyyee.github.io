I would like to argue that “gamification” is (or can be) a powerful tool that should be co-opted by the global health community. <!--more-->Gamification implemented correctly can do much to illuminate obscure processes, optimize healthcare pathways, and rejuvenate primary healthcare activities.

I was introduced to “gamification” long ago when I was still part of the game industry in the mythical city called San Francisco.  At first glance, “gamification” seems like one of those darling buzz words symptomatic of the Millennial generation, and indeed it has been an insufferable word made even more so by its underserved past.

First coined by Nick Pelling in the service statement from his short-lived consultancy in 2002, gamification sprang up momentarily in June 2009, lain dormant until July 2009 when it would rise inexplicably up the rankings. Since then, it has been readily expropriated by the business world in their never ending pursuit for coolness. Its uses so far have been painfully superficial – strictly Pavlovian in its extent. Consumers quickly wised up to these tactics seen as annoying add-ons to regular transactions of commerce. Buy from us and get points. Use those points to get stuff. And repeat ad nauseum. For employees, a special hell: work harder to be at the top of the leaderboard (a scarred whiteboard with oily smudges and tape fragments). Ugh. The main victims are customers and employees. It has been a convoluted interruption in the guise of fun, yet to demonstrate its full value.

 Gamification encompasses two main activities: user engagement and user retention. The problem is that so far the strategy has favored the retention side which has stunted its potential. It is the obvious result of the outcome-centric culture championed by professional managers. It needs to be done well and thoughtfully - a well crafted user experience leading to mutually beneficial outcomes for all.

 And so, on to the main points...

<h4>The Advantages</h4>
 <ul>
 <li>Illuminating obscure processes</li>
 <li>Optimizing healthcare pathways</li>
 <li>Rejuvenating primary healthcare activities</li>
 </ul>

Where engineers and scientist are content to leave systems as enigmatic boxes taking in inputs and feeding out outputs, it just doesn't work in the field of health, a field that prizes clarity and transparency. But so it has been continually self-assembling as more and more services flood the market. Many lack the understanding of how disparate services fit together to deliver care. Payments, for example, is a can of worms. Patients rowing with tellers are a common sight around hospital lobbies all over the world. Is there anyone who can explain the discrepancies between costs and charges? In the end, everyone is befuddled. It is no wonder how pervasive distrust perception of bureaucratic enigma, Kafkaesque or at worst full of trivialities.

Trust in healthcare has become a major research area in the past couple of years. U.S. found a massive drop off Monitoring the erosion closely, but to what degree are we addressing this issue

In the modern era, integration is the mantra of health systems development, and one of the most emphasized activities by intergovernmental bodies (you know who you are). It is the result of the legacy of missionaries. everybody doing their own thing persisting even today. While filling gaps where resources have been stretched thin surveillance disconnect to the larger governing body making population health planning and policy difficult

So a plan for integration is well-meaning but with little substance. One might imagine a unit convening in a carpeted room in Geneva HQ. what's your idea? Lets integrate so and so. But what this action entail? recommendation who's missing? a lot of stakeholders Gamification offer dissemination of our understanding of the system – of which every participant has some unique perspective The surgeon knows And nobody knows anything about hospital billing

But together we can figure this all out...

So the first step is system simulation. Here we translate existing processes and pathways "as-is." We like to have all the stakeholders participate in the development of the simulation. Having a multitude of diverse participants in this exercise really allows us to construct a comprehensive model.

But how do we go from simulation to game? It's only a simulation if there are no participants. So we'll have to open up some of the parameters for user-input/manipulation. This allows the players to see how certain actions or decisions affect the system as a whole. Every role will have their own unique set of parameters. Players will be able to find insights by playing with their set and also by rotating around and experiencing other roles.

defining goals "winning the game" budget certain budget but other positive outcomes reducing maternal mortality strive for a combination of goals

The primary lesson to take away build resilient and sustainable optimize expansion coverage
