<b>GOURNIA, CRETE </b> --- Excavations at Gournia, June & July 2014

I arrived a little after midnight. I was picked up from the tiny airport of Heraklion, a borderline derelict building that gives one visions of the 70s. It reminded me more of a warehouse than an airport. From there, we drove about an hour southeast to Pachia Ammos, a little seaside town on the Mirabello Bay, banking around the Mediterranean landscape. We ran into sparse pockets of civilization here and there, and in the darkness in between, dodged the glances of speed cameras.

One last curve now before entering Pachia Ammos. They pointed out the passenger window, "There's Gournia". I looked out the passenger window and was introduced to the silhouette of Gournia where I would spend the next two months.

We started at "Trench 103" completing excavation of Harriet Boyd's earlier house site. Like all other buildings in Gournia, only a few meters of the foundation remained of what was once a house. The dwellings of Gournia were thought to be two-storied with the entrance being from the pebbled street to the 2nd floor. We dug through the current floor reaching bedrock within a few days. The length of the pickaxe blade being the marker for the amount of days, weeks, months, years stripped away layer by layer. Contrary to popular belief, bedrock is not some permanent, immovable layer. You can chip it off as I have accidentally from time to time. But there is nothing below this point. You can't build a foundation here. It's too uneven.

And that was that.

Coming from San Francisco, the 100 degree days were hellish. We lunched in the shade of an abandoned stoa (a storehouse). At the beginning, I went to the neighborhood shops and lugged back six-packs of water after every break. pop it in the freezer for the next day. drink it as it melts They said the water was potable.  

That first morning, I went early to the bakery and got a spanakopita (a spinach pastry with feta cheese) for a euro. I know some of the economy relied on the patronage of project workers, but I had to mind my budget. make regular trips after work to pick up stirfried spaghetti cucumbers, sausages  had a few meals lasagna greek yogurt with honey

If you remembered the Olympic games, you might recall hearing about Greece's wild cat problem. The games were in the mainland. But even on the island of Crete, cats were  en masse bought balogna (I hate balogna ) wild cats when I did feast I tossed morsels of fish and bread (probably to the dismay of the owners) rough matted fur

I stayed at the eastern edge of town. One of the last restaurants on the block was Natasha's.

I entered staircase in between the restaurant and the apartment.  I heard somewhere that the Cretans keep their buildings unfinished for tax purposes. I'm not sure how true that was, but there were certainly a lot of houses with rebar sticking out - probably not a design choice. Before you get to my room you could hop over to the roof of the restaurant. I took a few nights here to stare at the stars. It was remarkable, the sky was really like a dome, and the shape of the dome conveyed such a vastness.

The next assignment brought us to the northern part of the city (facing the sea). We worked in the trenches of what would turn out to be a major pottery-making complex. At the end of the dig, you could see the characteristic workbenches and the remains of multiple furnaces. The whole building faced the sea so ships arriving from other cities would have first been impressed by the crowning industry of Gournia as they docked into her harbor.

In between the palace and the pottery center was an uncanvassed mound where a tree had entangled its roots holding together a little island of soil firmly. Later on, I would "clean up" some of the accessible patches of dirt finding an array of pottery and miscellaneous items like shells. It was a massive trove of stuff but unusable due to their decontexted state. Obsidian glass was my favorite find - an amazing object to pick out of the sieve if one was so lucky. Obsidian still sharp enough to be used in surgery. Other special finds included seal stones and even a pottery wheel with an engraved horse. Occasionally full cup specimens would turn up. A scorpion may have popped up in the trench next door.

On the days off, I had the fortuitous luck to join several groups going on excursions around the island so that I was never in want. I visited other cities or other sites.

A few weekends, I wandered off alone. You can go two blocks to one of the marts and purchase a round trip bus for a few euros. The timetable is on the shop's glass door. The buses were quite something - reused tour buses with luxurious seats and air conditioning.

One of my companions (a graduate student studying the history Knossos) had talked about a possible ceremonial path behind the palace of Knossos.  looking for the tombs placed in the side of the mountain. We left behind the crowds. We traversed through a few backyards to reach the base of the mountain.
